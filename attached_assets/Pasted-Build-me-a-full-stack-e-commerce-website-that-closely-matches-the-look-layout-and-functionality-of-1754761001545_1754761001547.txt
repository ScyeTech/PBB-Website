Build me a full-stack e-commerce website that closely matches the look, layout, and functionality of amrod.co.za, but using the Amrod API for real product data.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React + Next.js

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: SQLite or JSON cache to store API results temporarily (for faster page loads).

Requirements:

API Integration

Connect to the Amrod API (I will provide the base URL and API key as environment variables).

Pull product list, stock counts, prices, categories, and images directly from the API.

Sync data on a schedule (e.g., every 6 hours) and cache locally.

Frontend Pages

Homepage with hero banner, category grid, and search bar.

Product listing page with multi-select filters (category, color, branding options, price range, stock availability). Filters must work exactly like amrod.co.za (no page reloads).

Product detail page showing multiple images, product specs, available branding options, and stock per color/size.

Branding calculator that calculates branding cost in real time based on branding method, quantity, and API pricing.

Cart & Quote request flow — add to cart, request a quote, or proceed to checkout.

Checkout page with placeholder payment integration for now.

Branding Calculator Logic

Pull branding price table from Amrod API.

Calculation formula: total = (base price × qty) + (branding price × qty).

Live updates when user changes quantity or branding method.

Backend

Express routes for:

Fetching and caching product list from Amrod API

Fetching product details by ID

Fetching branding pricing

Submitting quote requests

Store quotes in SQLite with fields (customer name, email, phone, products, branding, quantity, notes).

General

Fully responsive design.

Similar visual style to Amrod SA (colors, layout, spacing, typography) but without using their copyrighted text.

Cleanly separate API calls so I can later change endpoints or authentication easily.

Prepare for deployment to Vercel or Netlify, and allow connecting to my custom domain pbb.co.bw.

Environment Variables:

AMROD_API_KEY — my API key.

AMROD_API_URL — base API URL.

Goal: A working site with real data from Amrod API, filters, branding calculator, and quote/cart flow ready for styling and final touches. Output all code, folder structure, and setup instructions so I can run this on Replit immediately.
